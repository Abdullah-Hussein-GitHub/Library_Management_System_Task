# Library_Management_System_Task
Library Management System Document

System is contained from backages, resources, banner, and log file

Backages divided into :

Controllers : contain controllers for each screen

Models : for handling each request and response for end-user

Repositories : for handling data source and communicate with data base

Services : for handling business logic for each requirement (interfaces)

Service_Impl: for handling all business logic

Entities : for creating entities like book and patron

Utils : for anything common use

Resources : contain main folders like banner and application. Properties

 Banner : for handling name of the system till running the app

application. Properties : for config every thing in the app

Log file : for handling what is running in the background and what happened in case of facing errors

Note: I will work on the basic security, AOP, and  the unit test requirements, then i will upload the whole project again
